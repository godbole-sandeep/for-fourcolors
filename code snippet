/*
What happens if a function declaration appears multiple times in a source file?
- If a function declaration appears multiple times, it does not cause a compilation error.

What happens if a class declaration appears multiple times in a source file?
- If a type, such as a class, is declared multiple times, it will result in a compilation error.

Then, how can errors due to the appearance of a class declaration multiple times be prevented?'
- Use include guards or #pragma once in the header file.

Does a class appearing multiple times in the translation unit ever happen?
- A class appearing multiple times in the translation unit can indeed happen,
  even though we intentionally never repeat a class multiple times in a source file.
- This usually occurs due to indirect inclusion, where a header file that contains
  the class declaration is included in multiple other files, leading to multiple
  appearances of the class in the final translation unit.
- Such scenarios can cause compilation errors, which is why include guards or
  '#pragma once' are essential to prevent this issue.
