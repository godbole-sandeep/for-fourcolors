/*
What is an RTTI?
- It stands for Run-Time Type Information.
- It provides a mechanism to retrieve type information of objects at runtime.

What is typeid?
- typeid is an operator.
- The argument to typeid can be an object or a data type.
- It returns an object of type_info type.
- Include typeinfo.h to access type_info object's members.

What is an application of the typeid operator?
- If 'n' is a 'int' variable, typeid(n) and typeid(int) yield the identical type_info object.
  Hence, expressions like typeid(n) == typeid(int) are true.
- The expression typeid(n) == typeid(double) returns false because typeid(double) returns
  a different type_info object than typeid(n).
