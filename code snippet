/*
What is a composition relationship?
- Composition is a type of relationship between two classes where one class contains
  an instance of another class as a part of its structure.
- Composition is also known as 'has-a' relation.
- The constructors of member objects are called first, before the constructor of the containing class.
- Destructors are called in the reverse order of construction.
- Therfore, the destructor of the containing class runs first, followed by the destructors of its member objects.
