/*
What are the key points to note in the program above?
- The program illustrates the usage of essential standard string library
  functions, such as 'strcpy_s', 'strcat_s', 'strlen', and 'strcmp'. 
- Both 'strcpy_s' and 'strcat_s' are safer versions of 'strcpy' and 'strcat' because
  they check the size of the destination buffer before performing any action.
- In the past, 'strcpy' and 'strcat' were popular, but they were unsafe since they
  did not check the size of the destination buffer.

What do strcpy_s, strcat_s, strlen and strcmp do?
- strcpy_s: Copies a string to a destination buffer while checking the buffer size
  to prevent overflow.
- strcat_s: Appends a string to the end of a destination buffer while ensuring the
  buffer size is not exceeded.
- strlen: Returns the length of a null-terminated string.
- strcmp: Compares two strings lexicographically and returns an integer indicating
  their relationship.
  
What integer values does strcmp return?  
- The strcmp function returns the following integers:
  1. 0: If the two strings are equal.
  2. Negative Value: If the first string is lexicographically less than the second string.
  3. Positive Value: If the first string is lexicographically greater than the second string.
